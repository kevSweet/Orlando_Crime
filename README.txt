****Project Summary*****
************************

The purpose of this research project was to study the density, location, trend and rate of change of crime in Orlando between 2009 and 2015.
The hypothesis was that crime in Orlando was becoming more frequent and was spreading from more urban areas into the suburbs. In order to
test this hypothesis, two different methods were used.

The first method attempted to identify how the crimes were distributed across the city. 
Two different unsupervised machine learning techniques were used in the programming language R to identify clusters of crime that can be categorized
into crime neighborhoods. These crime neighborhoods were then tracked over the timeframe to identify how the size, shape, and location of them changed.
The results of this analysis did not reveal any significant changes to the shape or size of these neighborhoods, so an alternative method was explored.

This alternative method was to generate a heatmap of the orlando area to show where the most dense regions for crime was happening at different 150 day time intervals.
Using the time series of heatmaps, interesting trends where identified at locations around Orlando such as cyclical behavior, upward/downward trends, and no change.*
